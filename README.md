# Robo_Racer_Robot

Robo Race bot created by students of RoboTech Club at National Institute of Science Education and Research in an attempt for participating in competitions. The purpose of the project is to learn the use of transmitter and receiver and for wireless interactions. And the bot was made for participating the competitions organized in techfests.

# Time Line

- Start of Project - 4 January 2024
- Participation in NIRMAN 3rd Edition in Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar - 19 February 2024

# Problem Statement

There will be a race track and the racing track will have many obstacles and elements of surprises. Each obstacle has a task and the bot is supposed to the task. If the bot performs the task full points will be given to bot for completing the obstacle or if the bot don't perform then no points will be given. The team is allowed to skip obstacles if they are unable to do but some points are deducted from the team as penalty and if the team toches the bot to keep it back in track then the team has to pay penalty of time. In this way 2 bots will compete with each other. Time taken by every bot will be noted. The bot which completes the track in least time wins the competition.

# Concept/Theory

The concept used for building the bot is that the receiver receives some values from the transmitter given by the user and the user has the control of the transmitter by using the joysticks and the buttons in the transmitter. The user gives input according to the action he wants the bot to perform. The receiver gives the input given by user to microprocessor and then the bot performs the task accordingly.

# Equipments Used

- Arduino UNO
- Breadboard, Jumper Wires, Switch(SPST)
- Li-ion battery 3S: ~12V
- LN 298N Motor Driver
- Acylic Used to make Chassis
- Johnson Motors ×4
- Motor Wheels ×4
- Hinge
- Nut and Blots for attaching Wheels
- Flysky FS-CT6B Transmitter
- Receiver
- Nuts & Blots, Glue gun, Soldering iron, Double Tapes and Tapes

# System Architecture

At the very starting we have put the 2 front motors of the bots. Arduino is setup in the front for ease in uploading of code. Nearly at the centre the battery is placed. After battery the breadboard is placed and it interacts with every component of the system for ground and for 5 V power supply. After breadboard the receiver and the Motor Driver are placed sideways. At the very end we have placed our 2 back motors of the bot.

# Mechanical Design

The 2D design is created in Onshape and then we used Laser cutter to get precise design in the Acrylic. We made the bot in shape of cuboid. The dimension of the cuboid was 170mm × 300mm × 70mm. At the top cover we put a hinge at the posterior part of the bot a small box cut at top for fitting switch. The design can be found in the link below.
